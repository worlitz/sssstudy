lexical defination:
1、不广不窄
2、定义中不能出现相同或者含义更不清的词语。
3、保持词语的模糊性
4、尽可能与情感基调相匹配

stipulatice definition （简写语言用）
不一定正确但一定很有用

recursive defination

Logical positivism
LP says any untestable statement is without meaning(But LP itself is untestable 尴尬)

Pragmatism（If the truth or falsity of a statement could make no practical difference to 
anyone, then it has no meaning）

analytic statement = logically necessary truth
synthetic statement = contingent

posteriori = empirical
priori = rational
for example
（
A posteriori: “Some bachelors are happy.” 
A priori: “All bachelors are unmarried.”
）

Most of our knowledge in math and logic is analytic a priori. Most of our 
everyday and scientific knowledge about the world is synthetic a posteriori.
